LINE MANAGER ROLES,,,"Line Manager roles have the responsibility and authority to ensure effective operation of their charity (the Scout Group, the Scout District, etc.) so that the charitable objectives are met.
For ACTING roles ….
Acting roles apply where there is no Line Manager (GSL, DC, etc.) appointed.  An Acting role is intended to be a temporary role pending a substantive appointment.  The length of appointment should be measured in months rather than years..
Because of the  short-term nature of the role, there are few in-role training obligations.  Persons appointed to these acting roles should already have undertaken Modules 1, GDPR, Safety, Safeguarding, 2, 4 and Trustee Introduction.  
It will also be helpful if the person appointed has previously completed a Manager & Supporter Wood Badge."
